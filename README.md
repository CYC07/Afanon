# Advanced Text Anonymizer

A powerful and configurable Python script for identifying and anonymizing sensitive information within text documents. This tool employs a multi-layered approach, combining Named Entity Recognition (NER), regular expressions, custom wordlists, and fallback heuristics to provide comprehensive PII redaction.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Layered Detection:**
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Leverages NLTK to identify entities like `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, `LOCATION`, `DATE`, `MONEY`, etc. (configurable).
    *   **Regular Expression (Regex) Matching:** Pre-defined and customizable regex patterns to detect common PII like emails, phone numbers, SSNs, credit card numbers, IP addresses, physical addresses, and postal codes.
    *   **Custom Wordlist Anonymization:** Allows users to supply their own lists of sensitive words/phrases (e.g., passwords, specific object names, dog breeds, project codenames) for targeted redaction.
    *   **Fallback Capitalized Word Detection:** A heuristic to catch potential names that might be missed by other methods.
*   **Flexible Anonymization Strategies:**
    *   `placeholder`: Replaces sensitive data with generic placeholders (e.g., `[PERSON]`, `[EMAIL]`).
    *   `counter`: Replaces with unique, numbered placeholders (e.g., `[PERSON_1]`, `[PERSON_2]`).
    *   `fake`: Substitutes PII with realistic-looking but synthetic data generated by the Faker library (e.g., "John Doe" for a name, a fake address for a real one).
*   **Intelligent Overlap Resolution:** When multiple detection methods identify overlapping text, the script prioritizes matches based on specificity (regex/custom lists > NER > fallback) and length to ensure accurate anonymization.
*   **Highly Configurable:**
    *   Specify which NER entities to target.
    *   Provide custom files for passwords, objects, dog breeds, or a generic wordlist.
    *   Choose the anonymization strategy.
    *   (Advanced) Modify built-in regex patterns directly in the code.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Easy to integrate into workflows for processing text files.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Offers insights into the anonymization process, including found entities and applied replacements (with verbose/debug mode).
*   **Automatic NLTK Data Check:** Ensures necessary NLTK resources are available and attempts to download them if missing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   Required Python packages (will be installed from `requirements.txt` if provided, or manually):
    *   `nltk`
    *   `Faker`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-text-anonymizer.git
    cd advanced-text-anonymizer
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install nltk faker
    ```
    (If a `requirements.txt` file is added to the project, users can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

3.  **NLTK Data:** The script will automatically check and attempt to download required NLTK data packages (`punkt`, `averaged_perceptron_tagger`, `maxent_ne_chunker`, `words`) on its first run. Ensure you have an internet connection.

### Usage

The script is run from the command line:

```bash
python anonymizer.py <input_file> <output_file> [options]
